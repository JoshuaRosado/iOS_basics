//Strong and Weak references

//Differentiate between Strong and Weak references in UIKit
//Practice using closures and examine the use of delegates within UIKit


//A quick illustration:
//Imagine a person holding a balloon. In this analogy, the person is the strong object, and the balloon is the weak object. If the person lets go of the balloon, the balloon disappears.


// to make a reference weak, we use the keyword "weak"


//let imageView:UIImageView =
//let task = session.dataTask(with: , completionHandler: {data, response, error in imageView.image = UIImage(data: data)
//})
